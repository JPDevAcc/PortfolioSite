							<h4 class="my-subsection-subtitle">Summary</h4>
							<p>
								This was the final project undertaken with the <b>Developer Academy</b>, and ran for four weeks.
								Like previous projects, it made use of the <b>MERN stack</b>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Groups could select a website theme of their choosing, with some optional suggestions provided by the instructor.
								Our group of three settled on a <b>fitness-app</b> with features such as work-out and dietary recommendations along with social posts and messaging.
							</p>
							<p>
								There was a strong emphasis on <b>project-management</b> and <b>agile methodologies</b>,
								and to that effect we made use of tools such as <b>user-stories</b>, <b>weekly sprints</b>, and <b>daily-standups</b>, 
								all of which helped us to plan and prioritise features for implementation.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4 class="my-subsection-subtitle">Division of work</h4>
							<p>
								We generally allocated specific features / tasks to individual team members. 
								This had the advantage of allowing us to work mostly independently and helped to avoid complicated merge-conflicts.
								It also meant that everyone had a roughly equal opportunity to gain further familiarity with both <b>front-end</b> and <b>back-end</b> development.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h5>My main contributions</h5>
								<ul style="list-style: none;" class="ms-0 ps-0 fw-bold">
									<li>User registration / Account management options</li>
									<li>Site preferences / Profile settings</li>
									<li>Dashboard (with notifications, goal progress, and BMI calculator)</li>
									<li>Contacts / messaging system</li>
								</ul> 
								I also assisted with the back-end <b>authorization</b> and <b>session-management</b> code and was the manager for the two GitHub repositories.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4 class="my-subsection-subtitle">The development process</h4>
							<p>
								This started with the creation of around fifteen user-stories from hypothetical user-groups who we believed would be interested in using our app.
								Following from this, we created a related list of development tasks, with priority given to those requirements
								which we felt were more critical to the success of the site, some of which were then allocated to the first sprint.
							</p>
							<p>
								The remainder of this first week was then spent developing a basic website framework with working authentication and session-handling.
								We decided to use
								<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session">express-session</a>
								in conjuction with
								<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/memorystore">memorystore</a>
								for the latter, which worked well for us after some initial cookie-related difficulties.
								We also experimented with an external API to retrieve themed images from the <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unplash</a> image-library.
							</p>
							<p>
								The second week saw the addition of <b>account-management options</b>, and a profile <b>"goals"</b> tab.
								Sections were also added which drew on data from external APIs.<br>
								These included an <b>"Exercises"</b> section, drawing data from <a href="https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/">ExerciseDB</a>,
								and a <b>"Recipes"</b> section using data from <a href="https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition">Spoonacular (Recipe - Food - Nutrition API)</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The third week saw the implementation of <b>social posts</b>, the <b>contacts / messaging / notifications system</b>, a <b>BMI calculator tool</b>, and a section where users could 
								attempt various <b>challenges</b> such as doing a certain number of exercises or activities within a specified time-span.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the final week, there was a greater emphasis on testing, bugfixing, and validation / security, 
								but we also had the opportunity to add a few more features and these included a 
								<b>"custom workouts"</b> section and a <b>weight-goal progress bar</b> (with weight history recorded by the back-end). 
								A further minor addition was the inclusion of a "loading spinner", displayed when network requests exceeded a certain time threshold.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4 class="my-subsection-subtitle">Retrospective</h4>
							<p>
								This was a challenging project.
								We were able to fully or partially satisfy most of the 'core' requirements but some did prove too ambitious, 
								given the project time-span, and our limited familiarity with some of the technologies in use.
								Nevertheless, the team worked well together, and the functionality we did implement worked well for the most part, 
								with just a few known issues remaining at the end of the four-week period.
							</p>
							<p>
								I personally found it to be a valuable learning experience, 
								especially in the opportunity it afforded to gain a better understanding of MongoDB (and non-relational databases in general),
								and also to further improve my GitHub management skills.
							</p>
							<p>
								In terms of possible improvements if such a project were to be carried out in the future, I believe that tasks could be prioritised a little more effectively, 
								as there were a couple of days spent on features that were abandoned due to technical problems while other more critical development tasks were still outstanding.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's also possible that the project would have benefitted from a test-driven-development approach, but given the additional time required to write tests covering all functionality, 
								it's not certain whether this would have led to a better outcome.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, in terms of improvements that could be made to the site as it currently stands, there are a number of areas / features that could be prioritised.
								These include <b>fixing any remaining known issues</b> and <b>extending automated test coverage</b>, improved <b>front-end and back-end validation</b>, 
								better <b>account security</b> (with e-mail address validation and optional 2FA), and support for <b>finding users by approximate location</b>.
