							<p>
								This was a recent project carried out for <a href="https://providr.uk/">Providr Ltd</a> to design and implement a support application
								allowing both potential and existing customers to easily contact the company's helpdesk for business queries or technical assistance. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The company had recently moved from Vue2 to Vue3 for client-side application development, and it was also selected for this project.
								Primary responsibility for the front-end was initially given to a new volunteer, with my main focus to be the back-end functionality and admin-interface
								implemented in PHP / MySQL.
							</p>
							<p>
								My general design for the system could be likened to a hierarchical permission-based e-mail system and aimed to be quite flexible.
								While primarily an internal system, messages can also be sent from a web-form, and it's also possible to have messages sent to a regular e-mail inbox, 
								these being either copies of internal messages, or ones sent to individuals who don't have a full account on the system (e.g. potential customers that had just used the web-form).
							</p>
							<p>
								A couple of months into the project, I would also take over the front-end after the employee working on it left the organisation.
								Some basic groundwork including some initial work on the "Messages" page was in place by this point and proved to be a good starting point, although the rest of the UI and the state management and network code still remained to be completed. 
								This in-fact proved to be a good opportunity to make improvements to some general-purpose client-side network code that I had been working on as part of previous projects.<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								Overall, I found all aspects of this project to be highly rewarding and constructive for my personal development in gaining better familiarity with Vue3 and with improving my UX and database-design skills, and I'm very happy with the end-result.
							</p>
