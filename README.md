# PortfolioSite
My portfolio website, created as a project for The Developer Academy Web Development Bootcamp.

Features a main page (with a link to my downloadable CV) and a sub-page for each project I have chosen to showcase.

The Bootstrap CSS library is used, mostly for its layout classes, and some custom CSS has been added as well. A small amount of JavaScript is also employed, which is active on the main page, although all main site functionality will work with JS disabled.
